## Features

- **Easy Conversion**: Quickly convert Overture map data into STL format.
- **User-Friendly**: Simple command-line interface.
- **Open Source**: Contribute to the project and help improve it.
- **Customizable**: Modify settings to fit your specific needs.

## Installation

To get started, clone the repository and install the required packages. You can do this by running the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Anorfy/overture2stl.git
cd overture2stl
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

After installation, you can use the application by running:

```bash
python main.py <input_file> <output_file>
```

- `<input_file>`: The path to your Overture map data file.
- `<output_file>`: The desired path for the output STL file.

## How It Works

Overture2STL reads Overture map data and processes it to create a 3D model. The application uses Python libraries to parse the input data and generate the STL file. 

1. **Input Handling**: The application reads the Overture map data and validates the input.
2. **Data Processing**: It converts the map data into a 3D representation.
3. **STL Generation**: Finally, it outputs the STL file that can be used for 3D printing.
